# Comprehensive Plan for Addressing Fetch Errors

## Plan:

1. **Verify Backend Server**: Ensure that the backend server is running on `http://localhost:5001`. This is crucial for all fetch requests to succeed.

2. **Check Authorization Token**: Confirm that the `adminToken` is correctly set in local storage. If the token is missing or invalid, the fetch requests will fail due to authentication errors.

3. **Review API Endpoints**:
   - For `Users.jsx`: Verify that the endpoint `${API_BASE_URL}/api/admin/users?page=${currentPage}&search=${searchTerm}` is correctly implemented in the backend and returns the expected user data.
   - For `Groups.jsx`: Check the endpoint `${API_BASE_URL}/api/admin/groups?page=${currentPage}&search=${searchTerm}` for proper implementation.
   - For `Activities.jsx`: Ensure the endpoint `${API_BASE_URL}/api/admin/activities?page=${currentPage}&search=${searchTerm}` is functioning as intended.

4. **Implement Error Handling**: Ensure that the error handling in each fetch function is robust, providing clear feedback in the UI when errors occur.

5. **Testing**: After making the necessary checks and adjustments, test the application to confirm that the fetch requests are working correctly and that data is being displayed as expected.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
