# Serverless Function Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Changes Made:
- [x] Added `serverless-http` dependency to Backend/package.json
- [x] Modified Backend/index.js to import serverless-http
- [x] Removed server.listen() call from Backend/index.js
- [x] Exported the Express app wrapped with serverless-http as default
- [x] Created vercel.json configuration file in root directory
- [x] Installed dependencies with npm install
- [x] Added conditional server startup for local development
- [x] Updated Frontend API configuration to use relative paths in production
- [x] Updated Vercel configuration to properly handle both frontend and backend

## Next Steps:
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel and test the serverless function
- [ ] Ensure environment variables (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.) are set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Note: Socket.io WebSocket functionality may not work in standard Vercel serverless functions
- [ ] If WebSockets are needed, consider using Vercel's WebSocket support or alternative hosting

## Important Notes:
- The backend is now configured as a serverless function compatible with Vercel
- All API routes should work normally
- WebSocket features (Socket.io) may require additional configuration or alternative hosting
- Test the /health endpoint first to verify basic functionality
